# Todo-list
A to-do list is a simple tool that helps you keep track of tasks or items that you need to complete. It's a list of things that you need to do or remember, usually organized in order of priority or deadline.

To create a to-do list, you can start by jotting down all the tasks that you need to complete. Then, you can prioritize them based on their importance or urgency. You can also add notes or details about each task, such as the deadline, the estimated time required to complete the task, or any other relevant information.
